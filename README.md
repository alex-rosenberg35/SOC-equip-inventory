HU SOC Equipment Inventory System

Hofstra School of Communication

> What you should do (consider this an assignment) create a front end in PHP for students/users to authenticate and see the classes for which they are entered.  Some students are registered for multiple classes.  If the student is registered for a single class the student should only see that class listed.  If the student is registered for more than one class the student will see a drop down list from which the correct class will be selected.
> 
> For this exercise the passwords are stored in tblUser.  In production, the student will authenticate against the Hofstra login.  For now, use a dummy password.
> 
> For next week:
>  1. Propose a project management system for evaluation.
>  2. Evaluate the code you developed.
>  3. Alex will demonstrate how we can use session based authentication, e.g., using the authentication against one system to gain access to another.
